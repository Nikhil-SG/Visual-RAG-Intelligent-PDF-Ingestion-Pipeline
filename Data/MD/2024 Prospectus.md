**Program Description**
program offered by Manipal Institute
of Technology aims to produce
competent engineers who can design
engineered systems built from
seamless integration of physical
and cyber systems, which interact
with humans and environment.
Cyber Physical Systems applies
the principles of computer science,
communication, and control systems
to design, develop, test and evaluate
various automations. This program is
intensely designed to impart the best
knowledge about tools for modeling
physical systems and for designing
cyber components to solve the real
world challenges. Students will be able
to design engineering systems that
interact with humans and environment
and create solutions.

**Focus**
Cyber-physical systems, physical
systems which are highly integrated
and/or controlled by software, are
ubiquitous in many safety critical
domains, including automotive,
avionics, railways, healthcare,
atomic energy, power, and industrial
automation. The principles of design
and implementation of cyber-physical
systems are remarkably different
from that of other embedded systems
because of the complex integration
of dense and real valued real time
systems with software based discrete
automated control.
The physical processes are monitored
with various sensors and then
communicated through networking
to create an automated feedback

based embedded control system.
The automated/ smart systems
are modelled from the data points
through technological abstractions of
intelligent systems. Over the recent
years, there has been an exponential
growth in the number of companies
pursuing in this domain and offering
technological opportunities. It is an
interdisciplinary program that would
train and prepare students for the
required technological skill sets of
next generation.
Solutions to grand challenges
increasingly require reaching across
the boundaries of the cyber, physical
and human worlds. Cyber-Physical
Systems is designed to target the
growing and unmet need at the
intersection of computing, physical
system and human behavior.

**Career Prospects**
Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are
“engineered systems that are built
from, and depend upon, the seamless
integration of computational
algorithms and physical components.”
CPS engineering focuses on managing
inter- dependencies and impact of
physical aspects over cyber aspects,
and vice versa. With the development
of low- cost sensing, powerful
embedded system hardware, and
widely deployed communication
networks, the reliance on CPS for
system functionality has dramatically
increased. These technical
developments in combination with
the creation of a workforce skilled
in engineering CPS will allow the
deployment of increasingly capable,
adaptable, and trustworthy systems.
The tasks performed by the engineers
in this discipline evolve quickly,
reflecting on new developments or
changes in technology, according to
the preferences and practices of the
employers

**Program Description**

Sustainable design today has
become an integral part of not only
built environment but also a part of
business and community. This course
addresses features that are part of
the sustainable development goal set
by United Nations (SDGs 3, 4, 6, 7, 8,
9, 11, 12, & 13). We need to approach
the design holistically, from aspects
linked to place, people and natural
resources, responding towards climate
change. India has already started
developing new policies and codes
such as Energy Conservation Building
Code (ECBC). GRIHA rating and Green
building rating systems for different
typology of building has become a
trend in the society.
This course develops specialist
who could enable computation
and evidence based performance
modelling of proposed design, as well
as assess performance of the built
design. A truly sustainable design
would address continuously in a
self-sufficient manner,the needs of
changing time as well as resources
management.
Initially the course addresses
the fundamentals of good built
environment in terms of energy
flow, environment science and
green building design. Further the
student would be trained in skills of
computation, simulation and design
guidelines for a sustainable built
environment. This is unique multidisciplinary course combining science
of environment,mechanical and
electrical engineering and architecture
to fulfill the needs of the society.

**Focus**
This program aims to provide capacity
to the building professionals for
looking in to scientific & functional
requirements of building in terms
of economics of the Architecture
Engineering & Construction
market and building policies of the
place. It aims to prepare building
professionals towards the challenges
of computational design and Evidence
based design and to produce the next
generation building professionals
who can target the optimum solution
approach over the heuristic design.

with educational institutions as
academicians in sustainability and
related fields, acquiring doctorate in
related fields and work as researcher,

**Prof Varadesh Hiregange**
World today is passing through a
crisis of violence, of every kind –
violence connected to region, religion,
caste, class, nature, culture, science,
gender, economy, ecology, nation
and development. Education needs
to respond to the rising challenges
and hence, Gandhian Centre for
Philosophical Arts and Sciences
(GCPAS), MAHE is offering its first-oftheir-kind post-graduate programmes

![IMAGE_REF](2024 Prospectus_p263_img1.jpg)
- MA in Ecosophical Aesthetics and
MA in Art and Peace Studies, and
an undergraduate programme BA in
Aesthetics and Peace Studies.
In fact, there is a whole gamut of
arts, sciences and social sciences
which impart meaning to life and
hold insight into the resolution of the
crisis; philosophical exploration is the
basic bedrock of such a search and
media play a major role. The GCPAS
adopts this kind of an inter-disciplinary
and trans-disciplinary approach,
envisioning a peaceful, just, aesthetic
and ecosophically sustainable present
and future.
The Centre engages with
intersectionality of aesthetics,
philosophy, ecology, journalism,
Gandhian and peace studies.

The Centre offers
- BA in Aesthetics and Peace Studies
- MA in Ecosophical Aesthetics
- MA in Art and Peace Studies.
While different arts and philosophy
are a common thread in both the PG
programmes, Ecosophical Aesthetics
primarily deals with contemporary
ecological crises while the Art and
Peace Studies deals with social and
international crises.

![IMAGE_REF](2024 Prospectus_p263_img2.jpg)
The courses explore the ‘root’ of
different contemporary crises and
the way out/way forward/way within.
With this basis, both programmes
prepare students for a life of writing journalism, media and communication.
The undergraduate programme
in Aesthetics and Peace Studies
combines humanities and social
sciences with a focus in research. This
is also in tune with National Education
Policy-2020

programme.

**Program Description**
Digital approaches in molecular
diagnostic and molecular pathology
play huge role in the advancement of
health care and clinical practice. With
the advancement of technology-based
innovative diagnostics approaches,
conventional methods to diagnose
core pathology and prognostication of
diseases are facing some challenges.
Therefore, medical care industries
are encountering growing pressure
to introduce computational tools
to unravel molecular and imagebased pathological diagnostics.
Computational technology can reduce
the pressure of handling of gigantic
data, improve human based molecular
and pathological diagnostic, create
individual patient data-based Medicare
and precision medicine. Worldwide
demand of digital approaches is
mounting enormously in the patient
care and clinical practice industries.
However, without the understanding
of core concepts of detection
techniques and disease oriented
molecular markers, implementation
of computational approaches is not
feasible. On the other hand, demands
are growing for specially trained
personnel in digital diagnosis, which is
an inter-disciplinary domain. MAHEBlr is initiating this inter-disciplinary
course by their multi-domain expert
faculties in the field of optical based
tissue imaging, clinical pathology,
molecular biologist, cancer biomarkers,
radiology, -omics technology,
molecular imaging, image analyst, and
computational technology.
