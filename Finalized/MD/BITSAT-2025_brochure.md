at the end of the first year.

**4.** **Current Enrollment Restriction:**

Students currently enrolled in any programme at a BITS campus are not eligible to appear for BITSAT-2025.
Students who have passed the 12 [th] examination in 2023 or earlier are not eligible to appear for BITSAT
2025.

Admissions will be made purely on merit. The merit position of the candidate for admission will be based
on the score obtained by the candidate in the BITSAT-2025. However, their eligibility for admission is subject
to fulfilling the requirement of minimum marks in the 12 [th ] examination, as mentioned above.

**4.** **Details of BITSAT-2025:**

‘Computer Based Online test’ means the candidate sits in front of a computer and the questions are
presented on the computer monitor and the candidate answers the questions on the computer by using
keyboard or mouse. Each computer is connected to a server, which prepares the question set and delivers
it to the candidate on the computer. This is unlike the traditional paper-pencil based test, which is generally

V


offered on a single day to all candidates. _**Salient features of BITSAT-2025 are given below:**_

- A candidate may appear a maximum of two times in BITSAT-2025.

- The examination will be organized in two sets of dates, BITSAT Session-1 and BITSAT Session-2,
separated by a gap of a few weeks. The candidate can choose the Center, the Day, and slot of his/her
convenience to take the test, as described later in this document.
- A candidate may opt to appear twice, even at the time of the first application. Such a candidate will then
choose one slot from the first set of dates and another from the second.
- A candidate may opt for ‘Session-1’ or ‘BOTH’.

- A candidate may also choose to appear the second time after the first appearance. To facilitate this
process, there will be a period during which candidates who have appeared during Session-1 but had
not originally exercised the option to appear twice, will be allowed to apply to appear a second time.

- Those who did not apply/appear in Session-1 can also apply to appear in Session-2 during the second
application window as mentioned in ‘Important dates and deadlines’ below.
- The application window will reopen for Session-2 after the first date of Session-1 of BITSAT.
- A candidate who chooses to appear twice will have to pay a sum of Rs. 5500 (for a male candidate) and
Rs. 4500 (for a female candidate), Rs. 4500 (for a transgender candidate).
- A candidate who opts to appear once (Session-1 or Session-2), will pay a fee of Rs. 3500 (for a male
candidate) Rs. 3000 (for a female candidate), and Rs. 3000 (for a transgender candidate).
- If a candidate who opts to appear to Session-1 only, chooses then to apply separately to appear a second
time (Session-2), then such candidate will have to pay an additional sum of Rs. 2000 (for a male
candidate), Rs. 1500 (for a female candidate), and Rs. 1500 (for a transgender candidate).
- If a candidate chooses Dubai as a test center for either Session-1 or Session-2, then the application fee
for male/female/transgender candidates will be Rs. 7150 (in INR). However, if the candidate wants to
appear for both the sessions then the prescribed fee will be Rs. 9150. If a candidate who originally opts
to appear once (Session-1) at Dubai Center and then apply to appear a second time (Session-2), then
such candidate will have to pay an additional sum of Rs. 2000 (in INR).
- The application fee is non-refundable and non-transferrable.
- For a candidate who has appeared twice in BITSAT-2025, and then seeks admission to any of the First
Degree programmes in BITS Pilani, the higher of the two scores will be considered for admission.

**BITSAT-2025 Test Format:**

Each session of BITSAT-2025 will be of 3 hours duration (without break), comprising the following 4 parts:
Part I: Physics
Part II: Chemistry
Part III: (a) English Proficiency and (b) Logical Reasoning
Part IV: Mathematics or Biology (For B. Pharm. & B.E. Environmental and
Sustainability Engg.)
**All questions are of objective type (multiple choice questions); each question with a choice of four**
**answers, only one being correct choice. Each correct answer fetches 3 marks, while each incorrect**
**answer has a penalty of 1 mark (-1 mark).**
**Attempting all the questions is NOT mandatory. No marks are awarded for questions un-attempted.**
**While the candidate can skip a question, the computer will not allow the candidate to choose more**
**than one option as the correct answer.**

VI


There will be 130 questions in all. The number of questions in each part is as follows:





|Part|Subject|No of Questions|
|---|---|---|
|Part I|Physics|30|
|Part II|Chemistry|30|
|~~P~~art III|(a) English Proficiency|10|
|~~P~~art III|(b) Logical Reasoning|20|
|Part IV|Mathematics (For all B.E., M.Sc. and B.Pharm. Programmes)<br>OR<br>Biology (For B. Pharm & B.E. Environmental and Sustainability<br>Engg. Programmes)|<br>40|
||**Total**|**130**|

There is no time limit for individual parts of the test. The candidate can go back and change any of his/her
answers among the 130 questions.

**If a candidate answers all the 130 questions (without skipping any question), the candidate will have**
**an option of attempting 12 (twelve) extra questions, if there is still time left. These extra questions**
**will be from Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics/ Biology and Logical Reasoning only; three questions**
**from each of them. Further, once the candidate has opted for extra questions, he/she cannot go back**
**for correction of any of the earlier answered 130 questions.**

The questions are so designed that a good student will be able to answer 130 questions in 180 minutes.
The extra questions (a maximum of 12) will give a chance to highly meritorious candidates to score higher.
However, candidates should keep in mind the fact that there is **negative marking** for wrong answers and
any attempt to answer the questions by pure guessing of the answers is not likely to have any advantage,
but may result in a reduction in the total score.

The questions will be selected at random from a large question bank. Different candidates will get different
question sets. An expert committee will ensure that the question sets are of comparable difficulty level,
content, question type etc. If a candidate finds any question to be potentially incorrect during the exam,
they can bring it to the notice of the invigilator present in the room, immediately. Such reports are duly
recorded at the test center. Following the completion of all test sessions, a detailed moderation process is
undertaken by our expert panel. During this process, if any question is found to be ambiguous or incorrect,
appropriate credit is awarded to all affected candidates, in line with the established guidelines.

In this matter, the decision of the expert committee will be final and binding on the candidate.

All the questions and instructions of the test will be in English only. Candidates should bring a pen for the
purpose of rough work, signing etc. A scratch pad for rough work will be provided. Calculators and
logarithmic tables are **not allowed** in the test centers. Candidates are not allowed to bring any other
personal belongings such as mobiles.

Each candidate who registers for BITSAT-2025 will be instructed to download a ‘Hall Ticket’. Candidates
with the hall ticket only will be allowed inside the Test centers. All centers are closely monitored for security
reasons and candidates’ identity and activities will be recorded using web cameras and/or closed circuit TV
cameras fitted in the test centers. Candidate’s finger print and photograph will be taken at the time of the
test (BITSAT-2025) and will be matched at the time of admission at particular BITS campus. Anyone violating
the rules of the test center will not be allowed to continue with the test and will automatically be disqualified.

**Syllabus:**

The BITSAT-2025 test will be conducted on the basis of NCERT syllabus for the 11 [th ] and 12 [th ] class. The
detailed syllabus is given in the Annexure. Candidates may refer to the NCERT textbooks for the contents.
